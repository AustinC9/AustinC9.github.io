                            <h5 class="card-title">Week One</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">My first week in the Awesome Inc bootcamp is not at all what i was
                                expecting. I
                                figured we would do a couple of warm-up fun games to ease into it. Oh buddy, let me tell
                                you, I was
                                very wrong. However, I sat down and started knocking out what seemed like an impossible
                                wall of
                                "actions". I knocked them out like Steph Curry hitting 3's. But in all seriousness, it
                                wasn't
                                anything unbearable and I have already learned more than I would have in one week of any
                                other
                                training.

                                Would you believe me if I told you I wasn't struggling??? Yeah, me either. First, i'm
                                practicing
                                using the terminal for all of my coding needs and not relying on the user friendly
                                github. Secondly,
                                just getting the git commands down. But the more I work on these things the better I
                                get. This first
                                week has been a confidence/competence roller coaster. I assume the rest of the bootcamp
                                will be as
                                well and my future in software developing.

                                I'm excited to just further my knowledge in coding and build my languages and
                                competence. I'm also
                                excited to build relationships with my instructors and fellow "battle buddies". Oh yeah,
                                and make
                                this blog look WAY better!</p>

                <div class="carousel-item">
                    <div class="card col-4 d-block mx-auto">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <h5 class="card-title">Week Two</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Prior to this bootcamp, I had no clue what pseudocoding was until I
                                taught a robot
                                how to make a PB&J. Now I chose a task that was essentially impossible, a self guided
                                rocket
                                landing, and made it seem relatively plausible. Pseudocoding helped me to break down the
                                complexity
                                into managable pieces. I can see why pseudocoding is an essential aspect to have in your
                                toolbag.

                                Right now I am struggling with making my blog look aesthetically pleasing. My end goal
                                is to have a
                                blog that resembles Reddit. Reddit is one of my favorite websites currently. But I will
                                get there
                                through perseverance! Other than that I have had a plentiful amount of A-HA moments!

                                For week two I have learned so much! I'm just excited to keep building my digital
                                literacy and any
                                knowledge within the full stack "dictionary"!</p>

                            <p class='card-text'>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all have a very important role together. They
                                all work cohesively to display information onto a web page. All three of them are so
                                feature rich that the possibilities of what you can do seem endless.</p>
                            <p class='card-text'>My blog currently isn't too feature rich, however, I have added a
                                navigation bar and two more seperate pages, and lastly a simple footer. I'm excited to
                                see what it will become with a little more practice!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Prework has taught me a lot of fundamentals of HTML,CSS, and
                                Javascript. I am still
                                building new knowledge everyday and working through problems as I run into them. I have
                                really
                                enjoyed the whole process, whether it was ripping my hair out at times or cheering
                                because I made it
                                through a blocker! Something I have found useful was to get myself into an environment
                                where I could
                                really focus and take the time to learn new materials. Ian and Justin have both been
                                really helpful
                                in guiding me in the right direction. It seems like they are always available too. Right
                                now just
                                the plethora of knowledge I have been learning is what is hindering me, however, i'm
                                excited for
                                next week to be able to devote my full time into this bootcamp. I've overcame some
                                obstacles such as
                                realizes the projects aren't as daunting as they seem and with a little reading and
                                trial and error
                                you can actually get them done. Most challenges I have overcame by asking Justin or Ian
                                and or using
                                google but not trying to play "code golf" based off the google results. I'm very eager
                                to get into
                                the classroom and officially meet all my battle buddies!</p>
