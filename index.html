 <p> My first week in the Awesome Inc bootcamp is not at all what i was expecting. I figured we would do a couple of warm-up fun games to ease into it. Oh buddy, let me tell you, I was very wrong. However, I sat down and started knocking out what seemed like an impossible wall of "actions". I knocked them out like Steph Curry hitting 3's. But in all seriousness, it wasn't anything unbearable and I have already learned more than I would have in one week of any other training.</p>
 <p> Would you believe me if I told you I wasn't struggling??? Yeah, me either. First, i'm practicing using the terminal for all of my coding needs and not relying on the user friendly github. Secondly, just getting the git commands down. But the more I work on these things the better I get. This first week has been a confidence/competence roller coaster. I assume the rest of the bootcamp will be as well and my future in software developing.</p>  
 <p> I'm excited to just further my knowledge in coding and build my languages and competence. I'm also excited to build relationships with my instructors and fellow "battle buddies". Oh yeah, and make this blog look WAY better! </p>
