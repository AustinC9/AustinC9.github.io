    <h2> Week One</h2>
 <p> My first week in the Awesome Inc bootcamp is not at all what i was expecting. I figured we would do a couple of warm-up fun games to ease into it. Oh buddy, let me tell you, I was very wrong. However, I sat down and started knocking out what seemed like an impossible wall of "actions". I knocked them out like Steph Curry hitting 3's. But in all seriousness, it wasn't anything unbearable and I have already learned more than I would have in one week of any other training.</p>
 <p> Would you believe me if I told you I wasn't struggling??? Yeah, me either. First, i'm practicing using the terminal for all of my coding needs and not relying on the user friendly github. Secondly, just getting the git commands down. But the more I work on these things the better I get. This first week has been a confidence/competence roller coaster. I assume the rest of the bootcamp will be as well and my future in software developing.</p>  
 <p> I'm excited to just further my knowledge in coding and build my languages and competence. I'm also excited to build relationships with my instructors and fellow "battle buddies". Oh yeah, and make this blog look WAY better! </p>
 
    <h2>Week Two</h2>
  <p>Prior to this bootcamp, I had no clue what pseudocoding was until I taught a robot how to make a PB&amp;J. Now I chose a task that was essentially impossible, a self guided rocket landing, and made it seem relatively plausible. Pseudocoding helped me to break down the complexity into managable pieces. I can see why pseudocoding is an essential aspect to have in your toolbag.</p>
  <p>Right now I am struggling with making my blog look aesthetically pleasing. My end goal is to have a blog that resembles Reddit. Reddit is one of my favorite websites currently. But I will get there through perseverance! Other than that I have had a plentiful amount of A-HA moments! </p>
  <p>For week two I have learned so much! I'm just excited to keep building my digital literacy and any knowledge within the full stack "dictionary"!</p>
