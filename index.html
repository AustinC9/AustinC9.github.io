                <p class="card-text">My first week in the Awesome Inc bootcamp is not at all what i was expecting. I
                    figured we would do a couple of warm-up fun games to ease into it. Oh buddy, let me tell you, I was
                    very wrong. However, I sat down and started knocking out what seemed like an impossible wall of
                    "actions". I knocked them out like Steph Curry hitting 3's. But in all seriousness, it wasn't
                    anything unbearable and I have already learned more than I would have in one week of any other
                    training.

                    Would you believe me if I told you I wasn't struggling??? Yeah, me either. First, i'm practicing
                    using the terminal for all of my coding needs and not relying on the user friendly github. Secondly,
                    just getting the git commands down. But the more I work on these things the better I get. This first
                    week has been a confidence/competence roller coaster. I assume the rest of the bootcamp will be as
                    well and my future in software developing.

                    I'm excited to just further my knowledge in coding and build my languages and competence. I'm also
                    excited to build relationships with my instructors and fellow "battle buddies". Oh yeah, and make
                    this blog look WAY better!</p>

                <p class="card-text">Prior to this bootcamp, I had no clue what pseudocoding was until I taught a robot
                    how to make a PB&J. Now I chose a task that was essentially impossible, a self guided rocket
                    landing, and made it seem relatively plausible. Pseudocoding helped me to break down the complexity
                    into managable pieces. I can see why pseudocoding is an essential aspect to have in your toolbag.

                    Right now I am struggling with making my blog look aesthetically pleasing. My end goal is to have a
                    blog that resembles Reddit. Reddit is one of my favorite websites currently. But I will get there
                    through perseverance! Other than that I have had a plentiful amount of A-HA moments!

                    For week two I have learned so much! I'm just excited to keep building my digital literacy and any
                    knowledge within the full stack "dictionary"!</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Week four</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Prework has taught me a lot of fundamentals of HTML,CSS, and Javascript. I am still
                    building new knowledge everyday and working through problems as I run into them. I have really
                    enjoyed the whole process, whether it was ripping my hair out at times or cheering because I made it
                    through a blocker! Something I have found useful was to get myself into an environment where I could
                    really focus and take the time to learn new materials. Ian and Justin have both been really helpful
                    in guiding me in the right direction. It seems like they are always available too. Right now just
                    the plethora of knowledge I have been learning is what is hindering me, however, i'm excited for
                    next week to be able to devote my full time into this bootcamp. I've overcame some obstacles such as
                    realizes the projects aren't as daunting as they seem and with a little reading and trial and error
                    you can actually get them done. Most challenges I have overcame by asking Justin or Ian and or using
                    google but not trying to play "code golf" based off the google results. I'm very eager to get into
                    the classroom and officially meet all my battle buddies!</p>
